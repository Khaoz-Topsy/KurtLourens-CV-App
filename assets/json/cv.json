I love creating beautiful and striking front-end user experiences, blazing fast APIs, services, etc, that follow best practices and building amazing user experiences for mobile. Working on so many projects as well as joining [redRubyIt] as a Co-Owner has taught me so much, not just about code, but also how to mentor, present, manage expectations and run projects. My goal is to continue learning all that I can and use that knowledge to create more opportunities to learn! üòÇ",

It was quite a tough fit as I did not have any real experience with Xamarin. This move was only temporary, as Hollard wanted me for a project that was to start soon after I joined. I learned a lot from working on that team and it sparked an interest in App Development. I went on to create the first version of TennoDex (Xamarin app with a C# .Net Core Api backend) in my spare time using what I had learned.",
